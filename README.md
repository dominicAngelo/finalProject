# Final Project

This is a calendar app used to schedule meetings all in one place keeping it clean and concise. 
You will have to install Qt5 on your computer and you might have to do some configuration on your own device to make sure it works. 
You will also need to use CMake, it can be easily installed and used in Visual Studio Code, just search for it in extensions. 
I am not 100% sure if you guys will need help. I am running Linux, so some things will work differently for me than you. 

## Prerecs 
- Qt5 not Qt6. It can only be Qt5. 
- CMake

### Build Instructions 
- Open bash 
- Navigate to /build directory
